# EEG Notebooks

A collection of classic EEG experiments implemented in Python and Jupyter notebooks. This repo is a work in progress with the goal of making it easy to perform classical EEG experiments and automatically analyze data.

Currently, all experiments are implemented for the Muse EEG device and based on work done by Alexandre Barachant and Hubert Banville for the [muse-lsl](https://github.com/alexandrebarachant/muse-lsl) library. 

Please consult the [documentation](http://eeg-notebooks.readthedocs.io/) to get started and learn more about the project.
